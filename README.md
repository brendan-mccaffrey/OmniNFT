# Gh0stlyGhosts

The contract files are named L0-chain. However, prior to deployment, the name of the actual contract is changed to the the chain-agnostic version "L0arb -> L0", "Gh0stlyGh0stseth -> Gh0stlyGh0sts".

The only different between each contract is the start ID (nextTokenID) and max mint tokens. This is so that minting on different chains do not conflict with one another, etc.

Mutants were used as sample metadata URI.
